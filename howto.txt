Installing Bash for Windows and Jekyll? I don't remember. You're on your own.
You might have luck in your programming bookmarks.
Update this when you figure it out again. ;)

Use the following commands
Open cmd.exe
Navigate to Jekyll project directory
Type "bash" in the command window to open a Bash prompt.
Type "jekyll serve" to get a server at localhost:4000 which watches for changes
Type "jekyll build" to build the static pages for the site (not required by GH)
I've never used any of the other commands. Good luck.
