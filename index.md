## Work Experience

**Engineering Co-op**  
*The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc.* | *Cambridge, MA* | *Jan. 2018 - Jun. 2018*
* I recently joined the Draper team, and I look forward to the opportunity to
contribute to their solutions!  

**Software Engineering Co-op**  
*Collins Aerospace (Rockwell Collins)* | *Cedar Rapids, IA* | *Jan. 2017 - Aug. 2017*
* Verified functionality and DO-178B Level A compliance for 75 Simulink models
upgraded from 2007a to 2016b
* Decreased build times via script enhancements by omitting unchanged models
from the build process
* Developed graphical and logical flight display software components to meet
customer requirements on time
* Eliminated a 30 minute environment setup task to update 200 files manually by
writing a batch script
* Developed a script to parse and sort C code lint violations into CSV format
leading to increased efficiency when analyzing multiple instances of similar
violations


**Application Developer**  
*Principal Financial Group* | *Des Moines, IA* | *May 2014 - Jun. 2016*
* Developed software in an Agile environment to rapidly provide business
critical features and application stability
* Administrated application servers and established governance for IBM
Operational Decision Management development
* Implemented an automated build, test, and deployment pipeline to increase
efficiency during IBM ODM development
* Developed a Ruby script which decreased regression suite execution time from
90 minutes to less than 5 minutes
* Mentored an intern on Agile methodology, Java EE development, and how to
evaluate business requirements  


**Hardware/Software Analyst Intern**  
*Vermeer Corporation* | *Pella, IA* | *Jan. 2017 - Aug. 2017*
* Deployed IT assets and supported tier I help desk support.

## Projects

* [**Developing a Sounding Rocket Model (C++)**](../MAT227)
    * Analyzed single versus multistage motor configurations with flight data
    generated for the Black Brant V and IX using a system of ordinary
    differential equations.
* [**Predicting Reliable Landing Times and Initial Velocity for a Lander in a Two-Body System (C++)**](https://github.com/carldevries/cis161-honors)
    * Conducted a parameter study to identify a curve fit to predict landing
    solutions for a lunar descent model.
* [**Analysis of Numerical Root-finding & Integration Methods (TI-BASIC)**](https://github.com/carldevries/mat217-honors)
    * Presented a comparison of implementations for 4 root-finding methods and
    3 numerical integration methods.
* [**American Society for Engineering Education Model Design Competition**](../ASEETYC)
    * Implemented a PID algorithm in C++ to navigate a vehicle about a 12 foot
    track 5 times in less than 60 seconds.
* [**Amazon Alexa Cyride Skill**](https://github.com/carldevries/cyride-alexa)
    * Developed an Amazon Alexa skill using Python and Amazon AWS to report
    when the next bus will arrive at a given stop.
