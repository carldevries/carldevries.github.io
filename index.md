90 minutes to less than 5 minutes
* Mentored an intern on Agile methodology, Java EE development, and how to
evaluate business requirements  


**Hardware/Software Analyst Intern**  
**Vermeer Corporation** | *Pella, IA* | *Jan. 2017 - Aug. 2017*
* Deployed IT assets and supported tier I help desk support.
